I spotted it in a junk shop in Bridport, a roll-top desk.
The man said it was early nineteenth century, and oak.
I had wanted one, but they were far too expensive. This
one was in a bad condition, the roll-top in several pieces,
one leg clumsily mended, scorch marks all down one
side. It was going for very little money
This is a story about the changing attitude of a girl child towards her
father. The Speaking and Writing exercises encourage the students to
think about the relationship between children and parents. The students
should be encouraged to say or write what they think, and not what the
teacher thinks they should say or write. The aim is not to arrive at
a ‘correct’ answer, but to let every child voice an opinion and express
her/his ideas. It is hoped that children will find the topic of personal
relevance. This will help their ideas and language to flow freely
One of the Germans was waving a bottle above his
head. “It is Christmas Day, Tommy. We have schnapps.
We have sausage. We meet you? Yes?” By this time there
were dozens of them walking towards us across no man’s
land and not a rifle between them. Little Private Morris
was the first up. “Come on, boys. What are we waiting
for?” And then there was no stopping them. I was the
officer. I should have stopped them there and then, I
suppose, but the truth is that it never even occurred to
me I should. All along their line and ours I could see
men walking slowly towards one another, grey coats,
khaki coats meeting in the middle. And I was one of
them. I was part of this. In the middle of the war we
were making peace.
