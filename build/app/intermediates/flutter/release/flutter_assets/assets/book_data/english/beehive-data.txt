A rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary,
cultural and sociological dimensions of texts. The themes range from
childhood and adolescence, to disability, talent and achievement, to
music, science, and contemporary social and environmental concerns.
The range is as inclusive as possible, keeping in view the interest and
cognitive development of the learners
The poems have been chosen for their simplicity and suitability in terms
of language and thought. We need not talk about the poet or the
background to the poem, unless the poem seems to demand it. Nor
should we attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of a poem; we should
encourage the students to begin to see some of the possibilities. They
should be guided to apprehend the poem through the visual, the auditory,
the tactile, the intellectual, or the emotional channels, and to understand
the suggestiveness of the images.
This is a story about the changing attitude of a girl child towards her
father. The Speaking and Writing exercises encourage the students to
think about the relationship between children and parents. The students
should be encouraged to say or write what they think, and not what the
teacher thinks they should say or write. The aim is not to arrive at
a ‘correct’ answer, but to let every child voice an opinion and express
her/his ideas. It is hoped that children will find the topic of personal
relevance. This will help their ideas and language to flow freely
